Hi `r glue::glue("{data$curriculum[1]}")` facilitators,

`r glue::glue("{data$pm[1]}")` is looking for `r glue::glue("{data$lead_facilitators[1]}")` lead facilitator`r if_else(data$lead_facilitators[1] > 1, glue::glue("s"), glue::glue(""))` and `r glue::glue("{data$tech_facilitators[1]}")` tech facilitator`r if_else(data$tech_facilitators[1] > 1, glue::glue("s"), glue::glue(""))` to staff the `r glue::glue("{data$site[1]} ")` `r glue::glue("{data$content[1]}")`.

`r glue::glue("{data$additional_comments[1]}")`


<!-- The dates and times are as follows: -->

```{r echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
# data$call_times %>%
#   knitr::kable(col.names = "")
```

If interested please select ALL the dates you would be able to facilitate!

```{r}
knitr::include_app("https://teachinglabhq.shinyapps.io/Survey/")
```


`r glue::glue("{data$pm[1]}")` will review facilitator availability on `r glue::glue("{data$response_time[1]}")` and reach out to you directly if you have been selected to facilitate or if he needs more information. Please respond to any communication within 48 hrs. to ensure timely staffing.

Thank you!

`r glue::glue("{data$pm[1]}")`
