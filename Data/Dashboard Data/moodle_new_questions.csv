I was given excellent tools and resources that I can implement in my classroom to help my students become stronger readers and critical thinkers. However, I do not feel that this course addressed issues that may arise with us going back to school in a COVID-19 environment. I taught 2nd grade before the shut down, and some of my students were so far behind that they couldn't even write a complete sentence. (A couple of my students read on a kindergarten level at the end of the year and a couple of them still wrote some letters backwards.) I worry that these students will not be prepared for the rigor of this curriculum. Even though the units will start off less complex and gradually build on themselves and the standards will spiral back, I worry that my incoming 3rd graders may be so far behind.

"I'm not sure if this question is asking about school opening ""during COVID-19,"" as we are still in the midst of the pandemic OR school opening after COVID-19 as in after the pandemic has past and we can return to ""normalcy,"" but I will respond to both.  When asked about small group instruction and collaborative groups, we were told to focus on the goals and learning targets of each lesson, each unit and each module.  What is the overarching goal?  What do we want our students to get out of this time spent collaborating and learning from one another.  I think that was a good response to a difficult question, but as educators, we are still trying to think about protocols in what may just be whole group discussions as we are practicing social distancing in our classrooms.  So, our vision of what EL looks like, sounds like and feels like is much different from what it will actually be when we are engaged in in-person learning starting on September 21st.  As far as literally ""after COVID-19,"" when we can engage in small group, collaborative discussions and in work that requires us to physically be closer together:  YES, I feel as though this course has helped me to prepare.  I can envision this setting.  I can see what it looks like, sounds like and feels like.  Will I be able to implement this in a few weeks?
