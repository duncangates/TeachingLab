What's the purpose of closing all these learnings gaps, as it relates to different mathematical concepts. Like why are all these different concepts and procedural so needed to be grasped? There have been learning gaps since the dawn of mandatory schooling and none of the money/resources we've thrown at this issue has helped much, so how can we truly make a difference from a systems perspective? What about the system is flawed or outdated? What about the system is skewed toward whites? Why are black and brown students on a whole scoring lower on national assessments? How do we change that from a national and district level? What districts or states are having tremendous success is closing gaps and why are they successful? 

There are a lot of why questions I have and answering the why questions helps me feel motivated to answer the how questions. I think some of the how questions were answered for me but not many why questions. In a sense, I feel  this was another superficial course on how to close learning gaps among students but will not actually produce any results because the system at large is flawed at so many levels. Yes, teachers can make a difference in the learning gaps but nationally we need to do some real evaluation and change.

I feel like this whole training could have been summed up with one sentence: ""Teach your grade level content while creating space/time for just-in-time support for scholars who have learning gaps."" And then maybe giving a list of what just-in-time support looks like.",3,"Because they ""course"" could have been summed up with an hour or less of information. ""Teach your grade level content while creating space/time for just-in-time support for scholars who have learning gaps."" And then maybe giving a list of what just-in-time support looks like. Yes, implementing these practices will help close some learning gaps. But there are so many more important topics to be discussing when it comes to learning and learning gaps. Once again many of the why questions connected to learning gaps are not brought up or discussed. It's like when Nixon was president he declared a ""war"" on cancer and threw all this money into research efforts to reduce cancer in America but nothing positive came about from his ""war on cancer"". Cancer only got worse and worse in America! Concerning Education, we are having all this discussion on learning gaps and what not but never seeking to understand the root of our issues in education across America. The education tree in America is dead or at best dying and we keep expecting to receive healthy fruit. Cut down the tree and plant a new one! Learn from nations or people groups who are getting great education results. 

We have been talking about learning gaps for decades and nothing has changed! Why? There is something bigger going on behind the scenes that needs to be addressed and changed.","Go into the history of these learning gaps. How did they come about? Has there been success in closing these gaps every? If so where and how? Why are we so concerned about closing the gaps? Why is knowing all these obligatory math standards so important? Students seem to not care about all the unrelated, unconnected, un-useful math standards, why should I be making sure there aren't gaps in their learning?",Illustrative Mathematics

When asked about small group instruction and collaborative groups, we were told to focus on the goals and learning targets of each lesson, each unit and each module.  What is the overarching goal?  What do we want our students to get out of this time spent collaborating and learning from one another.  I think that was a good response to a difficult question, but as educators, we are still trying to think about protocols in what may just be whole group discussions as we are practicing social distancing in our classrooms.  So, our vision of what EL looks like, sounds like and feels like is much different from what it will actually be when we are engaged in in-person learning starting on September 21st.  As far as literally ""after COVID-19,"" when we can engage in small group, collaborative discussions and in work that requires us to physically be closer together:  YES, I feel as though this course has helped me to prepare.

We compared text-to-text, text-to-self and text-to-world questioning to questions that lent themselves to deeper analysis and discussion.  Participants were able to see how questioning really propelled discussions to be deeper, more meaningful and to truly engage students in lasting learning.

The reflections in most sessions really helped us to review what we have learned, to make connections and to solidify that learning.","Given the fact that this was a three week summer bootcamp, I wasn't expecting much feedback from the facilitators, but it would have been nice to receive individualized comments related to some of the responses and work that was submitted.",10,"The course work was organized effectively.

Though we are adults and able to manage ourselves more than an average middle school child, the platforms are there to keep our students engaged, thinking, and sharing their theories about the texts they read. Protocols and structures are important in Covid teaching times and these were also greatly modeled for us throughout our time together.

The activity in session 12 was especially rigorous and supported my learning as I was able to connect how the protocols and supports reflect RTTW. It reminded me that these are all connected and are not isolated.","I think the only thing that I would try to improve is to have a folder where all the materials are rather than having to download everything then upload it back to the assignments. There is a lot of valuable, meaningful information here that I'd like to share with the teachers but having to download the videos and documents one by one will be time consuming for me.

I was given excellent tools and resources that I can implement in my classroom to help my students become stronger readers and critical thinkers. However, I do not feel that this course addressed issues that may arise with us going back to school in a COVID-19 environment. I taught 2nd grade before the shut down, and some of my students were so far behind that they couldn't even write a complete sentence. (A couple of my students read on a kindergarten level at the end of the year and a couple of them still wrote some letters backwards.) I worry that these students will not be prepared for the rigor of this curriculum. Even though the units will start off less complex and gradually build on themselves and the standards will spiral back, I worry that my incoming 3rd graders may be so far behind. I am grateful for this course, the awesome resources, and excellent insight I was given, but I wish there was a way for me to bridge the gap that my students will likely come to me with.","I am honestly just excited to teach Guidebooks in general.

It would have been nice to even briefly discuss ways we could still integrate the curriculum if we have to go online. Even if we don't switch to full virtual, students will be doing online work half the week, so we will need to know how to meet these students' needs on the days they are not with us face-to-face.",8,"It was an excellent training, but my only issue was that nothing in the training really addressed  how the curriculum could be taught virtually or ways it could be modified to meet students' needs during COVID-19.",NA,EL

I found the Zoom/Moodle experience to be scattered and non-sequential. There were quite a few times that I felt like I had missed something---an assignment or other. When I went back to review the assignments, I had not missed anything. I needed less time with you trying to convince me the importance of PD and more time on the actual unpacking of the curriculum. You called it ""unpacking"" but it never felt that way. Another issue was when we were broken into chat rooms. An example was the other day (I don't remember the assignment), but we were supposed to spend 10 minutes on the first topic, 10 minutes on the 2nd topic and 2 minutes on the final summation. I had written this down when we were given the verbal instructions. The chat room time was only given around 10 minutes for the whole thing. Frustrating. I could have gotten the same knowledge by reading the teacher's manual and unpacking on my own first. Then I would have loved to have your expertise to help me understand more fully and answer my questions.

An hour would have been enough time to talk about all of that.",NA,"Everyone is very nice, but the content is repetitive. I feel like our students need to learn more than just reading and analyzing. This curriculum is outdated. We have students entering college and the work force and all they know how to do is annotate a text, form a literary claim, and prove their claim with evidence from the text. Does that make sense? They don't know how to write professionally and they don't know how to succeed in life.",3,"This entire thing is a huge slap in the face for educators. I hate to be so negative, but we are already implementing these skills in our classes. However, this curriculum is EXTREMELY boring. I am bored to death; I can only imagine how the students feel. Our students are also not able to do this work virtually from home.

As for the bootcamp itself, it is extremely long, boring, and repetitive. I feel like the instructors are just reading off of a generic script. None of this is making us a better teacher! We are exhausted and being pulled in a million different directions. I feel like there's so many other things that we could be spending our time on.",NA,NA

What's the purpose of closing all these learnings gaps, as it relates to different mathematical concepts. Like why are all these different concepts and procedural so needed to be grasped? There have been learning gaps since the dawn of mandatory schooling and none of the money/resources we've thrown at this issue has helped much, so how can we truly make a difference from a systems perspective? What about the system is flawed or outdated? What about the system is skewed toward whites? Why are black and brown students on a whole scoring lower on national assessments? How do we change that from a national and district level? What districts or states are having tremendous success is closing gaps and why are they successful? 

There are a lot of why questions I have and answering the why questions helps me feel motivated to answer the how questions. I think some of the how questions were answered for me but not many why questions. In a sense, I feel  this was another superficial course on how to close learning gaps among students but will not actually produce any results because the system at large is flawed at so many levels. Yes, teachers can make a difference in the learning gaps but nationally we need to do some real evaluation and change.

I feel like this whole training could have been summed up with one sentence: ""Teach your grade level content while creating space/time for just-in-time support for scholars who have learning gaps."" And then maybe giving a list of what just-in-time support looks like.",3,"Because they ""course"" could have been summed up with an hour or less of information. ""Teach your grade level content while creating space/time for just-in-time support for scholars who have learning gaps."" And then maybe giving a list of what just-in-time support looks like. Yes, implementing these practices will help close some learning gaps. But there are so many more important topics to be discussing when it comes to learning and learning gaps. Once again many of the why questions connected to learning gaps are not brought up or discussed. It's like when Nixon was president he declared a ""war"" on cancer and threw all this money into research efforts to reduce cancer in America but nothing positive came about from his ""war on cancer"". Cancer only got worse and worse in America! Concerning Education, we are having all this discussion on learning gaps and what not but never seeking to understand the root of our issues in education across America. The education tree in America is dead or at best dying and we keep expecting to receive healthy fruit. Cut down the tree and plant a new one! Learn from nations or people groups who are getting great education results. 

We have been talking about learning gaps for decades and nothing has changed! Why? There is something bigger going on behind the scenes that needs to be addressed and changed.","Go into the history of these learning gaps. How did they come about? Has there been success in closing these gaps every? If so where and how? Why are we so concerned about closing the gaps? Why is knowing all these obligatory math standards so important? Students seem to not care about all the unrelated, unconnected, un-useful math standards, why should I be making sure there aren't gaps in their learning?",NA

When asked about small group instruction and collaborative groups, we were told to focus on the goals and learning targets of each lesson, each unit and each module.  What is the overarching goal?  What do we want our students to get out of this time spent collaborating and learning from one another.  I think that was a good response to a difficult question, but as educators, we are still trying to think about protocols in what may just be whole group discussions as we are practicing social distancing in our classrooms.  So, our vision of what EL looks like, sounds like and feels like is much different from what it will actually be when we are engaged in in-person learning starting on September 21st.  As far as literally ""after COVID-19,"" when we can engage in small group, collaborative discussions and in work that requires us to physically be closer together:  YES, I feel as though this course has helped me to prepare.

We compared text-to-text, text-to-self and text-to-world questioning to questions that lent themselves to deeper analysis and discussion.

The reflections in most sessions really helped us to review what we have learned, to make connections and to solidify that learning.","Given the fact that this was a three week summer bootcamp, I wasn't expecting much feedback from the facilitators, but it would have been nice to receive individualized comments related to some of the responses and work that was submitted.",10,"The course work was organized effectively.

I made many connections between the work that we did and the work our students will do.,"Application activities where, after we read, we were asked to apply that learning to some kind of reflection or summary activity. The activity in session 12 was especially rigorous and supported my learning as I was able to connect how the protocols and supports reflect RTTW. It reminded me that these are all connected and are not isolated.","I think the only thing that I would try to improve is to have a folder where all the materials are rather than having to download everything then upload it back to the assignments. There is a lot of valuable, meaningful information here that I'd like to share with the teachers but having to download the videos and documents one by one will be time consuming for me. I want it all!",10,"Because this was extremely informative and like I said earlier, I think that this course modeled exactly how our students should be building their own knowledge about a topic. We engaged in Text,Task,Targets,Topics using the RTTW process as well as using the protocols and supports. They did a great job of embedding the practices of EL in this course which helped me make the connections I needed to know that it is possible for our students to be challenged and engage in rigorous learning activities even in these unprecedented times.
