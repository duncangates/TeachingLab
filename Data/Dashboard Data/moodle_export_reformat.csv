Buy-in is key and I know that not everyone does.,"I am brand new to EL and it seemed like I was supposed to already have experience with it. I found the Zoom/Moodle experience to be scattered and non-sequential. There were quite a few times that I felt like I had missed something---an assignment or other. When I went back to review the assignments, I had not missed anything. I needed less time with you trying to convince me the importance of PD and more time on the actual unpacking of the curriculum. You called it ""unpacking"" but it never felt that way. Another issue was when we were broken into chat rooms. An example was the other day (I don't remember the assignment), but we were supposed to spend 10 minutes on the first topic, 10 minutes on the 2nd topic and 2 minutes on the final summation. I had written this down when we were given the verbal instructions. The chat room time was only given around 10 minutes for the whole thing. Frustrating. I could have gotten the same knowledge by reading the teacher's manual and unpacking on my own first. Then I would have loved to have your expertise to help me understand more fully and answer my questions.
 
 The other issue for me is that many of the videos you had us watch were from charter schools and independent schools rather than public schools. Students behave far differently when they are in uniform or in an all girl's school.",You are clearly very knowledgeable and a believer in this curriculum.

I look forward to the students really digging deeply to uncover their own understanding and learning through deep and meaningful conversation with each other.  I am also looking forward to engaging in language dives as that was one part of this curriculum that I haven't really engaged in before.  In one way or another, other aspects of this program have been implemented.  It's exciting to think about how it will all come together once the class is fully engaged, already versed in protocols and having systems in place.",I like the way we delved into activities that the students would be engaged in.  It really provided perspective as we worked through activities and collaborated with participants.  We learned through doing.,"The first Zoom meeting really stands out in my mind as we engaged in a deep dive close read of several different texts.  We compared text-to-text, text-to-self and text-to-world questioning to questions that lent themselves to deeper analysis and discussion.  Participants were able to see how questioning really propelled discussions to be deeper, more meaningful and to truly engage students in lasting learning.

The reflections in most sessions really helped us to review what we have learned, to make connections and to solidify that learning.",Given the fact that this was a three week summer bootcamp -  I wasn't expecting much feedback from the facilitators -  but it would have been nice to receive individualized comments related to some of the responses and work that was submitted.,"The course work was organized effectively.  I feel like I engaged in work that will help me unpack the curriculum with confidence.  I am excited to engage in this work, planning for differentiation and preparing for individual learners.  I think when engaging with a new curriculum, the work ahead seems arduous and not exciting, but it definitely DOES NOT feel that way with the EL curriculum.

When asked about small group instruction and collaborative groups, we were told to focus on the goals and learning targets of each lesson, each unit and each module.  What is the overarching goal?  What do we want our students to get out of this time spent collaborating and learning from one another.  I think that was a good response to a difficult question, but as educators, we are still trying to think about protocols in what may just be whole group discussions as we are practicing social distancing in our classrooms.  So, our vision of what EL looks like, sounds like and feels like is much different from what it will actually be when we are engaged in in-person learning starting on September 21st.  As far as literally ""after COVID-19,"" when we can engage in small group, collaborative discussions and in work that requires us to physically be closer together:  YES, I feel as though this course has helped me to prepare.  I can envision this setting.  I can see what it looks like, sounds like and feels like.  Will I be able to implement this in a few weeks?

I look forward to the students really digging deeply to uncover their own understanding and learning through deep and meaningful conversation with each other.  I am also looking forward to engaging in language dives as that was one part of this curriculum that I haven't really engaged in before.  In one way or another, other aspects of this program have been implemented.  It's exciting to think about how it will all come together once the class is fully engaged, already versed in protocols and having systems in place.",I like the way we delved into activities that the students would be engaged in.  It really provided perspective as we worked through activities and collaborated with participants.  We learned through doing.,"The first Zoom meeting really stands out in my mind as we engaged in a deep dive close read of several different texts.  We compared text-to-text, text-to-self and text-to-world questioning to questions that lent themselves to deeper analysis and discussion.  Participants were able to see how questioning really propelled discussions to be deeper, more meaningful and to truly engage students in lasting learning.

The reflections in most sessions really helped us to review what we have learned, to make connections and to solidify that learning.",Given the fact that this was a three week summer bootcamp -  I wasn't expecting much feedback from the facilitators -  but it would have been nice to receive individualized comments related to some of the responses and work that was submitted.,"The course work was organized effectively.  I feel like I engaged in work that will help me unpack the curriculum with confidence.  I am excited to engage in this work, planning for differentiation and preparing for individual learners.  I think when engaging with a new curriculum, the work ahead seems arduous and not exciting, but it definitely DOES NOT feel that way with the EL curriculum.  I am excited to plan and I'm looking forward to engaging in the teaching and learning that will occur in my classroom.",NA,10,EL,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,"I'm not sure if this question is asking about school opening ""during COVID-19,"" as we are still in the midst of the pandemic OR school opening after COVID-19 as in after the pandemic has past and we can return to ""normalcy,"" but I will respond to both.  When asked about small group instruction and collaborative groups, we were told to focus on the goals and learning targets of each lesson, each unit and each module.  What is the overarching goal?  What do we want our students to get out of this time spent collaborating and learning from one another.  I think that was a good response to a difficult question, but as educators, we are still trying to think about protocols in what may just be whole group discussions as we are practicing social distancing in our classrooms.  So, our vision of what EL looks like, sounds like and feels like is much different from what it will actually be when we are engaged in in-person learning starting on September 21st.  As far as literally ""after COVID-19,"" when we can engage in small group, collaborative discussions and in work that requires us to physically be closer together:  YES, I feel as though this course has helped me to prepare.  I can envision this setting.  I can see what it looks like, sounds like and feels like.  Will I be able to implement this in a few weeks?

What's the purpose of closing all these learnings gaps -  as it relates to different mathematical concepts. Like why are all these different concepts and procedural so needed to be grasped? There have been learning gaps since the dawn of mandatory schooling and none of the money/resources we've thrown at this issue has helped much -  so how can we truly make a difference from a systems perspective? What about the system is flawed or outdated? What about the system is skewed toward whites? Why are black and brown students on a whole scoring lower on national assessments? How do we change that from a national and district level? What districts or states are having tremendous success is closing gaps and why are they successful? 

There are a lot of why questions I have and answering the why questions helps me feel motivated to answer the how questions. I think some of the how questions were answered for me but not many why questions. In a sense -  I feel  this was another superficial course on how to close learning gaps among students but will not actually produce any results because the system at large is flawed at so many levels. Yes -  teachers can make a difference in the learning gaps but nationally we need to do some real evaluation and change.

I feel like this whole training could have been summed up with one sentence: ""Teach your grade level content while creating space/time for just-in-time support for scholars who have learning gaps.""

Has there been success in closing these gaps every? If so where and how? Why are we so concerned about closing the gaps? Why is knowing all these obligatory math standards so important?

There was not a prompt to follow, and in the morning session, the presenter used a different name for the document were were supposed to look at.

We spent quite a bit of time looking for the name of the document the presenter said only to realize that it was titled something else. To make this better, all documents that are to be used for each session should be linked in the agenda. Even if we have to make a copy, we can see what the document looks like to locate it in our own folders. Prior to going to breakout, a prompt should be given on the Nearpod screen or in the agenda so that we know what it is that we are supposed to be doing or discussing each time.

2021-01-25,"Delaware Department of Education, DE",Christi Denning,Cleveland Cohort 3 EL Modules Bootcamp,I am looking forward to diving deeper into the curriculum. I do this this curriculum would work so much better if we were in person and the students had workbooks in front of them. I look forward to using the engagement protocols more with my students too.,I loved the times when we were in breakout rooms with our colleagues. I learn most from people that are doing the same work that I am doing. I got some new ideas and I also shared some ideas that has worked for me.,I loved the engagement protocols videos.,"1. Better communication about the activities that we were doing would of been much more helpful. I rarely understood what we were doing and I thought I was the only one. As we were put into breakout rooms no one knew what we were supposed to be doing.2. I don't think the audience was taken into consideration for what I thought the course was going to be. It felt like this course was one big advertisement for EL. This curriculum has so much to offer. But we as teachers are given only a password to the online platform. We have to open up so many tabs and documents every time we go to plan or teach a lesson. During this course it never seemed anyone took that into consideration. I teach 4th grade- EL requires quite a few note catchers which if a kid had a notebook in front of them that is way easier than trying to have the kids create a note catcher, put the note catcher in Seesaw, or create an interactive notebook. Being remote I have tried all three of the last ideas and there is no easy way. Also, Module 2 requires 2 books for the students to use. One was Venom which I found in Sora and I couldn't find ""Animal Behaviors: Animal Defenses"" After looking and looking, I finally asked our MLT and emailed the ELA person from our District to find the second book. I was directed to some folder inside the ""TEAMS"" site. These are things that should be shown to teachers so we don't have to be FBI agents for a book we need to teach the curriculum. Also, this book I was referring to is 136 pages long and needs to be uploaded/downloaded every time I or a student opens it which is very inconvenient. I bought ""Venom"" on my own (which I shouldn't have to do) so I could open up one less tab which is making my life much easier.3. I thought this course would be more about how we can better use this EL curriculum in a ""hybrid"" setting and how would be best to plan better. How can you read a 15-18 page narrative which is recommended for each hour lesson and implement all of it. The answer is ""You Can't"" no one can. We are put on so many timelines and it gets ridiculous. We as teachers are trying to do the best we can with a huge new curriculum, everything online , and trying to meet deadlines/timelines that are completely unrealistic.4. I think it would be helpful to hear from teachers who have done or are currently teaching this curriculum effectively.","I really did not feel that I have learned anything in this course that I didn't know before. I was really disappointed. This to me was how great EL is and if you have all of the materials you need and the kids were in person then this would all be happening. The reality is I really do like EL but it is very overwhelming and teachers need ways in which they can be successful with no paper book manuals, no student manuals. Having students do all of the things that EL suggests online is way harder than it looks virtually. I think even in person getting it all done is going to be next to impossible. We as teachers will continue to do the impossible the best way we can.",No,2,EL,Agree,Agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Disagree,Agree,"This course has helped me navigate the EL platform a little better.

2021-01-29,"Delaware Department of Education, DE",Elizabeth Van Hoesen,Cleveland Eureka Math Bootcamp K-5 - Cohort 2,"I am most excited about using the effective mathematics teaching practices to guide my lessons and instruction. While in this course, I found that learning is actually a mental change. It isn't something you learn once and toss away. You need to build upon steps, questions, ideas, and concrete math terms. This will help students keep the skills within and know when to apply them in the grades now, in upper grades, and in daily living and problem solving. The Rigor review of analyzing grade level assessments to see the skills students will need to be college and career ready. You don't just look at the can the students answer the problems, you realize the problems are embedded in deeper understanding of the sequences of skills previously learned and the student will apply the knowlege. The ""notices and wonders"" is a great activity to get all students involved with the math experience. There is nothing wrong in what someone notices or wonders when analyzing a question, story, diagram, etc. The other is the ""3 reads"". It is really important to read the math problems, at least three times. Each time you read the problem, add a question that leads to ""what is the problem asking?""","The facilitators set the sessions up like classes. We were given information as a whole, discussed things as a whole, had break out sessions for deeper understanding, then reflected upon what we learned in the sessions. Each person learned different things and many times we agreed with our colleagues on their ideas or things learned in the sessions. The set-up created a remote learning environment for teachers.","The best activities were working on student tasks, reading new educational studies, and analyzing what we read. The best activity seemed daunting at first, the 3 reads. We had to choose a random math question, read through it 3 times, and add a different probing question each time we read it. The key was reading it to see ""what is the question asking?"" We actually read the question the first time, and thought it was harder than what it was, because we saw numbers and read the word problem superficially. We always ask our students, ""What is the problem asking you to do?"" We actually experienced what our students feel and we found the way, through experience, how to let our students come to the right answer.","The sessions could have been spread out rather than one day apart, it left minimal time to teach, prep for our current classes, and dive deeper in the pre-work before class. Including more ways Eureka can be taught in a remote environment, that leads to excitement for our students. We have been remote since March 16, 2020, our students need a reason to turn those computers on everyday.","I chose this rating because as a district using Eureka and teaching a large diverse population of students, more teachers would benefit from this experience. It forces those without hard copies to learn how to access materials online. It is a great community builder. I realized on the last day, that we were actually learning like our students in a remote environment, sometimes with our cameras on, sometimes with our cameras off.
