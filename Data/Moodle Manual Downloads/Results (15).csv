The learning from this coursebrings them back to the forefront and reminds me of the importance to use these strategies to engage students andprovide equity for all students in the class.","How, if in any way, this course helped you prepare for school opening after COVID-19?","The use of protocols and TPT's will actually be easier to implement after we move beyond COVID-19 restrictions.So many of the strategies involve pairing or grouping students, which we have not been allowed to do. When wecan return to ""normal"" we will be able to return to more of a workshop model of teaching, rather than the lecturetype model that COVID-19 has required of us.","Overall, what went well in this course?","I like when courses give an overview of the learning, then specify the focus to begin with, send us off to try it, and then come backtogether to share how it went and what could be done differently to make it better.  Then move to the next focus point and repeat.Overall I felt like the format worked pretty well.","Which activities best supported your learning in this course?","The assignments that had us implement our new learning.","What could have improved your experience in this course?","The times indicated onthe module site for how long each assignment would take are far from what it takes me to complete such tasks (not if you want them toactually be thoughtful and informative).I don't mind when some reading or researchis required, but it needs to be limited because we are still teaching full time during our course work.I found the module site difficult to manage during the cycle - often I didn't know what part we were on. Each section was identical except for the number representing what part we were in. When a course is being held for two days, I didn't know how that connected to the sections on module. It was confusing.","Why did you chose this rating","Christi appeared to have great knowledge about the subject matter, however she was not highly skilled at presenting it to us.Often times she repeated things when it wasn't necessary, made directions and expectations confusing, and didn't read thegroup well. She seemed to have an agenda for the course and didn't do well at deviating from it.

There was not a prompt to follow, and in the morning session, the presenter used a different name for the document were were supposed to look at. Materials are not well organized or easy for participants to find between sessions. We spent quite a bit of time looking for the name of the document the presenter said only to realize that it was titled something else. To make this better, all documents that are to be used for each session should be linked in the agenda. Even if we have to make a copy, we can see what the document looks like to locate it in our own folders. Prior to going to breakout, a prompt should be given on the Nearpod screen or in the agenda so that we know what it is that we are supposed to be doing or discussing each time. Breakout rooms were too long and most of the time we were sitting in silence until someone felt like they had to talk, upon which they said, ""I'm not really clear what we are supposed to be doing. Does anyone else know?"" And we did not.","Why did you chose this rating","The participants that are school districts are willing participants which means that they have the control to roll out this program in a way that is more aligned to all of the resources. CESA teams are at the mercy of what school districts want, and most of the time, they are calling us in after they have selected and want us to help them with implementation. We have tried to include these elements when we work with districts, but they ask us to take them out since they will take too much time. For small, rural school districts with limited resources and people, this is not a process that they would engage in. This course was built for school districts to utilize and implement, but not necessarily for CESA teams to try to force onto the districts we help.","Do you have additional comments about  this course","The state of WI needs to stop spending this large amount of money on outside companies and courses that do not necessarily represent what most districts need or want. They also need to stop being an agency that offers PD directly to districts. The state needs to engage with CESAs more to find out what our districts want or need and work with us to provide them with those resources and training and use the money on us, a state agency, not an outside, out-of-state agency.","The topics for this course were relevant for my role.",3,"The independent online work activities were well-designed to help me meet the learning targets.",1,"The Zoom meeting activities were well-designed to help me meet the learning targets.",1,"I felt a sense of community with the other participants in this course even though we were meeting virtually.",1,"This course helped me navigate remote and/or hybrid learning during COVID-19.",1,"I will apply my learning from this course to my practice in the next 4-6 weeks.",1,"Recommend this course to a colleague or friend.",0,"He/she/they facilitated the content clearly.",,"He/she/they effectively built a community of learners",1

2021-01-29,"Delaware Department of Education, DE",-,"Elizabeth - Van HoesenMary - Shaw-Lewis","Cleveland Eureka Math Bootcamp K-5 - Cohort 2","What is the learning from this course that you are most excited about trying out?","I am most excited about using the effective mathematics teaching practices to guide my lessons and instruction. While in this course, I found that learning is actually a mental change. It isn't something you learn once and toss away. You need to build upon steps, questions, ideas, and concrete math terms. This will help students keep the skills within and know when to apply them in the grades now, in upper grades, and in daily living and problem solving. The Rigor review of analyzing grade level assessments to see the skills students will need to be college and career ready. You don't just look at the can the students answer the problems, you realize the problems are embedded in deeper understanding of the sequences of skills previously learned and the student will apply the knowlege. The ""notices and wonders"" is a great activity to get all students involved with the math experience. There is nothing wrong in what someone notices or wonders when analyzing a question, story, diagram, etc. The other is the ""3 reads"". It is really important to read the math problems, at least three times. Each time you read the problem, add a question that leads to ""what is the problem asking?""","How, if in any way, this course helped you prepare for school opening after COVID-19?","It forced me to find the Eureka lessons online. I had a hard time finding materials, since I am an Intervention Specialist, and I do not have access to hard copy texts and educational platforms. I had to learn some of the platforms during this boot-camp. I definitely learned a sense of community with the facilitators and teachers. Now I will be able to reach out to teachers in my district and get help or ideas.","Overall, what went well in this course?","The facilitators set the sessions up like classes. We were given information as a whole, discussed things as a whole, had break out sessions for deeper understanding, then reflected upon what we learned in the sessions. Each person learned different things and many times we agreed with our colleagues on their ideas or things learned in the sessions. The set-up created a remote learning environment for teachers.","Which activities best supported your learning in this course?","The best activities were working on student tasks, reading new educational studies, and analyzing what we read. The best activity seemed daunting at first, the 3 reads. We had to choose a random math question, read through it 3 times, and add a different probing question each time we read it. The key was reading it to see ""what is the question asking?"" We actually read the question the first time, and thought it was harder than what it was, because we saw numbers and read the word problem superficially. We always ask our students, ""What is the problem asking you to do?"" We actually experienced what our students feel and we found the way, through experience, how to let our students come to the right answer.","What could have improved your experience in this course?","The sessions could have been spread out rather than one day apart, it left minimal time to teach, prep for our current classes, and dive deeper in the pre-work before class. Including more ways Eureka can be taught in a remote environment, that leads to excitement for our students. We have been remote since March 16, 2020, our students need a reason to turn those computers on everyday.","Why did you chose this rating","I chose this rating because as a district using Eureka and teaching a large diverse population of students, more teachers would benefit from this experience. It forces those without hard copies to learn how to access materials online. It is a great community builder. I realized on the last day, that we were actually learning like our students in a remote environment, sometimes with our cameras on, sometimes with our cameras off. We took turns speaking aloud in discussions and utilized the chat if we did not feel like talking.","Do you have additional comments about  this course","Thanks for making this a math experience.

One of my biggest takeaways, which I plan to share during my collaborations with colleagues, is the valuable insight that can be gained through when identifying whether the task requires students to build understanding or express understanding. Information from that response can be used to implement a targeted strategy, such as working on an isolated area of difficulty, that best meets an individual student's needs. ","How, if in any way, this course helped you prepare for school opening after COVID-19?","In addition to delayed school re-openings after COVID-19, Calcasieu schools were also closed due to back-to-back severe weather events- Hurricane Laura (August 24, 2020- October 02, 2020) and Hurricane Delta (October 06, 2020- October 16, 2020). The four schools participating in the SPDG grant experienced significant damages and were some of the last schools to open with dates ranging  from October 21, 2020 to October 29, 2020.  In the absence BOY PD, collaboration opportunities with colleagues, as well as obstacles that impeded productive planning, this training provided participants with a much-needed boost and targeted guidance that can be used immediately in planning to support students with disabilities in writing. It also provided new insight on identifying and delivering appropriate writing supports and strategies that meet students' specific learning needs. ","Overall, what went well in this course?","As this training took place after work hours, the strict adherence to start/end times, was very much appreciated.  All materials presented were relevant and participants remained fully-engaged throughout each hour and a half session.  The pacing was great and the structured periods of collaboration were well-timed and yielded some productive conversations. ","Which activities best supported your learning in this course?","I liked the flow of the sessions. Having to complete asynchronous activities in advance, which challenged us to develop our own understanding.

I found the Zoom/Moodle experience to be scattered and non-sequential. There were quite a few times that I felt like I had missed something---an assignment or other. When I went back to review the assignments, I had not missed anything. I needed less time with you trying to convince me the importance of PD and more time on the actual unpacking of the curriculum. You called it ""unpacking"" but it never felt that way. Another issue was when we were broken into chat rooms. An example was the other day (I don't remember the assignment), but we were supposed to spend 10 minutes on the first topic, 10 minutes on the 2nd topic and 2 minutes on the final summation. I had written this down when we were given the verbal instructions. The chat room time was only given around 10 minutes for the whole thing. Frustrating. I could have gotten the same knowledge by reading the teacher's manual and unpacking on my own first. Then I would have loved to have your expertise to help me understand more fully and answer my questions.
 
 The other issue for me is that many of the videos you had us watch were from charter schools and independent schools rather than public schools.

We must provide the time and space for this, get out of the way, and talk less. I love the idea that the text is the expert in the room, rather than the teacher. ""What does the text say?""","How, if in any way, this course helped you prepare for school opening after COVID-19?","Initially I had a hard time believing that our students are able to engage in small group discussions or be members of collaborative teams. But the activities that we engaged in via zoom and break out rooms illustrated that this is possible. Though we are adults and able to manage ourselves more than an average middle school child, the platforms are there to keep our students engaged, thinking, and sharing their theories about the texts they read. Protocols and structures are important in Covid teaching times and these were also greatly modeled for us throughout our time together. It's possible!","Overall, what went well in this course?","The activities that repeatedly brought us back to do our own close reading of the texts. The questions we were asked were thoughtful and rigorous. The workshop in general utilized the same protocols and supports that we are expected to use in the EL curriculum with our students. I made many connections between the work that we did and the work our students will do.","Which activities best supported your learning in this course?","Application activities where, after we read, we were asked to apply that learning to some kind of reflection or summary activity. The activity in session 12 was especially rigorous and supported my learning as I was able to connect how the protocols and supports reflect RTTW. It reminded me that these are all connected and are not isolated.","What could have improved your experience in this course?","I think the only thing that I would try to improve is to have a folder where all the materials are rather than having to download everything then upload it back to the assignments. There is a lot of valuable -  meaningful information here that I'd like to share with the teachers but having to download the videos and documents one by one will be time consuming for me. I want it all!","Why did you choose this rating?","Because this was extremely informative and like I said earlier, I think that this course modeled exactly how our students should be building their own knowledge about a topic. We engaged in Text,Task,Targets,Topics using the RTTW process as well as using the protocols and supports. They did a great job of embedding the practices of EL in this course which helped me make the connections I needed to know that it is possible for our students to be challenged and engage in rigorous learning activities even in these unprecedented times.

I look forward to the students really digging deeply to uncover their own understanding and learning through deep and meaningful conversation with each other.  I am also looking forward to engaging in language dives as that was one part of this curriculum that I haven't really engaged in before.  In one way or another, other aspects of this program have been implemented.  It's exciting to think about how it will all come together once the class is fully engaged, already versed in protocols and having systems in place.","How, if in any way, this course helped you prepare for school opening after COVID-19?","I'm not sure if this question is asking about school opening ""during COVID-19,"" as we are still in the midst of the pandemic OR school opening after COVID-19 as in after the pandemic has past and we can return to ""normalcy,"" but I will respond to both.  When asked about small group instruction and collaborative groups, we were told to focus on the goals and learning targets of each lesson, each unit and each module.  What is the overarching goal?  What do we want our students to get out of this time spent collaborating and learning from one another.  I think that was a good response to a difficult question, but as educators, we are still trying to think about protocols in what may just be whole group discussions as we are practicing social distancing in our classrooms.  So, our vision of what EL looks like, sounds like and feels like is much different from what it will actually be when we are engaged in in-person learning starting on September 21st.  As far as literally ""after COVID-19,"" when we can engage in small group, collaborative discussions and in work that requires us to physically be closer together:  YES, I feel as though this course has helped me to prepare.  I can envision this setting.  I can see what it looks like, sounds like and feels like.  Will I be able to implement this in a few weeks?  I strongly doubt that, but as the months pass by, I hope that this vision will be possible.","Overall, what went well in this course?","I like the way we delved into activities that the students would be engaged in.  It really provided perspective as we worked through activities and collaborated with participants.  We learned through doing.","Which activities best supported your learning in this course?","The first Zoom meeting really stands out in my mind as we engaged in a deep dive close read of several different texts.  We compared text-to-text, text-to-self and text-to-world questioning to questions that lent themselves to deeper analysis and discussion.  Participants were able to see how questioning really propelled discussions to be deeper, more meaningful and to truly engage students in lasting learning.

The reflections in most sessions really helped us to review what we have learned, to make connections and to solidify that learning.","What could have improved your experience in this course?","Given the fact that this was a three week summer bootcamp -  I wasn't expecting much feedback from the facilitators -  but it would have been nice to receive individualized comments related to some of the responses and work that was submitted.","Why did you choose this rating?","The course work was organized effectively.

What's the purpose of closing all these learnings gaps -  as it relates to different mathematical concepts. Like why are all these different concepts and procedural so needed to be grasped? There have been learning gaps since the dawn of mandatory schooling and none of the money/resources we've thrown at this issue has helped much -  so how can we truly make a difference from a systems perspective? What about the system is flawed or outdated? What about the system is skewed toward whites? Why are black and brown students on a whole scoring lower on national assessments? How do we change that from a national and district level? What districts or states are having tremendous success is closing gaps and why are they successful? 

There are a lot of why questions I have and answering the why questions helps me feel motivated to answer the how questions. I think some of the how questions were answered for me but not many why questions. In a sense -  I feel  this was another superficial course on how to close learning gaps among students but will not actually produce any results because the system at large is flawed at so many levels. Yes -  teachers can make a difference in the learning gaps but nationally we need to do some real evaluation and change.

I feel like this whole training could have been summed up with one sentence: ""Teach your grade level content while creating space/time for just-in-time support for scholars who have learning gaps."" And then maybe giving a list of what just-in-time support looks like.","Why did you choose this rating?","Because they ""course"" could have been summed up with an hour or less of information. ""Teach your grade level content while creating space/time for just-in-time support for scholars who have learning gaps."" And then maybe giving a list of what just-in-time support looks like. Yes, implementing these practices will help close some learning gaps. But there are so many more important topics to be discussing when it comes to learning and learning gaps. Once again many of the why questions connected to learning gaps are not brought up or discussed. It's like when Nixon was president he declared a ""war"" on cancer and threw all this money into research efforts to reduce cancer in America but nothing positive came about from his ""war on cancer"". Cancer only got worse and worse in America! Concerning Education, we are having all this discussion on learning gaps and what not but never seeking to understand the root of our issues in education across America. The education tree in America is dead or at best dying and we keep expecting to receive healthy fruit. Cut down the tree and plant a new one! Learn from nations or people groups who are getting great education results. 

We have been talking about learning gaps for decades and nothing has changed! Why? There is something bigger going on behind the scenes that needs to be addressed and changed.","Do you have additional comments about  this course?","Go into the history of these learning gaps. How did they come about? Has there been success in closing these gaps every? If so where and how? Why are we so concerned about closing the gaps? Why is knowing all these obligatory math standards so important?

I love teaching and learning English, and this curriculum really seems well rounded and wholesome. I can't wait to get my students excited about learning!","How, if in any way, this course helped you prepare for school opening after COVID-19?","I believe this course helped prepare me for teaching the curriculum in a regular classroom setting. I was given excellent tools and resources that I can implement in my classroom to help my students become stronger readers and critical thinkers. However, I do not feel that this course addressed issues that may arise with us going back to school in a COVID-19 environment. I taught 2nd grade before the shut down, and some of my students were so far behind that they couldn't even write a complete sentence. (A couple of my students read on a kindergarten level at the end of the year and a couple of them still wrote some letters backwards.) I worry that these students will not be prepared for the rigor of this curriculum. Even though the units will start off less complex and gradually build on themselves and the standards will spiral back, I worry that my incoming 3rd graders may be so far behind. I am grateful for this course, the awesome resources, and excellent insight I was given, but I wish there was a way for me to bridge the gap that my students will likely come to me with.","Overall, what went well in this course?","I loved the community atmosphere that all the teachers had with one another. It was great to hear from other teachers and to hear everyone's suggestions and insight. As a new teacher, I appreciate getting feedback and learning from experienced teachers.","Which activities best supported your learning in this course?","Overall, everything we did helped me learn. Everything was interactive and engaging and it was great that we were given chances to talk in smaller groups.","What could have improved your experience in this course?","My only concern with this training is that there really weren't many suggestions given that would help return to school in a COVID-19 environment. It would have been nice to even briefly discuss ways we could still integrate the curriculum if we have to go online. Even if we don't switch to full virtual -  students will be doing online work half the week -  so we will need to know how to meet these students' needs on the days they are not with us face-to-face.","Why did you choose this rating?","It was an excellent training, but my only issue was that nothing in the training really addressed  how the curriculum could be taught virtually or ways it could be modified to meet students' needs during COVID-19.","Do you have additional comments about  this course?",,"I am satisfied with the overall quality of this course",4,"The topics for this course were relevant for my role.",5,"The independent online work activities were well-designed to help me meet the learning targets.",5,"The Zoom meeting activities were well-designed to help me meet the learning targets.",5,"I felt a sense of community with the other participants in this course even though we were meeting virtually.",5,"This course helped me navigate remote and/or hybrid learning during COVID-19.",5,"Recommend this course to a colleague or friend.",8,"He/she/they facilitated the content clearly.",5,"He/she/they effectively built a community of learners",5
