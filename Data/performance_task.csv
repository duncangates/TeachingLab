My answer is not because of the integrity of the course, the suggestions or the ""gist"" of the course. The instructors were excellent.  The philosophy of equity and responsibility is also. But I cannot recommend this course in light of covid-19. I feel teaching EL through distance learning with integrity would not be possible.","There was difficulty with navigating between guides and other materials for me. I feel that the open source guides would be much easier to use if, when a direction is made, the page and book where the material is found was included.",1,"I chose this rating because I do not feel that EL can be taught correctly with distance learning. There is almost no support for using these materials that way. If a school pays this much money for this program, every part should be easily accessed by a student at home, and teachers should not have to put it into google or another program themselves.

It seemed to create adversarial relationship between some of the learners and facilitators. It was uncomfortable from that point on but not so much that it ruined my experience. (It is generally better to confine negativity, real or perceived, to as small a group as possible rather than broadcast its presence and magnify its effects on the larger group.)"
