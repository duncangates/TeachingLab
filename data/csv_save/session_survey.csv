I appreciated that a lot.  Additionally, she is great at giving specific directions and is very clear in her communication. I also appreciated the connection from the target/ objective to the specific activity. I hadn't seen that done before but it helped orient everyone. ","There were many things: 1.  I just wanted to say thanks for the dedication to collecting survey data and then implementing it.  I love how transparent you all are about this.   2. You set up most if not all activities to have processing time first.  This is great for introverts and just as a way for everyone to collect their thoughts before sharing out. 3. You took feedback, specifically around creating a safe space for participants and did that before we started any student model. ","I think there were two main things; 1. directions were sometimes unclear or confusing. 2. The pacing somehow felt off today. While I understand why modeling the MLR had to happen, it felt like we had basically just done that specific one after the previous model. So for the future, perhaps choosing a very different MLR to model might help.  Also, I get frustrated when the times change after we are sent to breakout rooms.  I get it that you need to make everything fit.  Our group had budgeted the time according to the original times we were given.  I totally understand making changes before we are sent  to breakout rooms, but as a result three members didn't get to share and I felt badly. Finally, I'm wondering if there is a way to ""pep"" things up especially when we hit the 2:30/3:00 mark. I know this is a lot and I want to make sure everyone knows the session was still great.  These are just the ideas I had. "

It seemed to be the same few that would do all of the talking.  2 schools were all on one device and that just does not work well for this type of professional development.  Irasburg said that they could not talk because they were all on one computer in the hallway.  I would think that the admin should make sure that they have a quieter space and set up for PD.

Some teachers are saying we have to video tape ourselves teaching. The lack of direction and clarity and purpose is very concerning. Am I going to be evaluated?

Directions were not always clear. And I've been using and teaching this curriculum for 3 years, I don't understand what I'm supposed to be getting from this professional development. I feel like I'm mostly helping the rest of the people from different schools who are newer to this curriculum when we are in breakout rooms rather than learning anything new myself.",We started and ended on time.,"It would be nice if this were more relevant. I feel like what we are learning, I already learned from our district resource teachers/district math department over the last 2+ years. This is probably helpful for teachers new to the curriculum, but I'm not learning anything new which is frustrating. There was a brief mention of culturally relevant teaching, but it was very brief and nothing clear or concrete was given."

We were struggling with the connection and then the prompt and what our HOW and WHY is.  I was really confused about what we were supposed to be thinking about there and it felt like we were being guided in a certain direction by the facilitator but I don't think we ever got there.

Facilitator seemed more confident and purposeful.",I really enjoy the Tower of Hanoi activity. And having time to work on it independently.,"The afternoon 45 minutes that was spent on ""practicing"" facilitating an Number Talk was ridiculous. Half of us have been doing these for several years. Others were still trying to understand how to interact with the curriculum. The sample warm ups chosen for us to use seemed very random for people who were unfamiliar with them. More information on the hows or whys might have been helpful. Also, I was hoping that we would be given time to actually dig in to the materials/curriculum and start adapting and tweaking it so that it is more culturally responsive and connecting/relatable for our students. Lastly, will there be any conversation about filling in missing learning gaps from last year? We only taught half of the curriculum to our students. This is going to be an issue."

Seeing as though I was part of the research team that first started this initiative these last few days have felt overwhelmingly repetitive.  It would have been helpful to have had two separate trainings one for those who are new to the curriculum and one for the ones who have already implemented this curriculum in their classrooms.  It would have also been more beneficial for  us to have some help and time to plan with our school sites on how to adjust this curriculum to be more culturally relevant to our students. ,Providing the questions in the chat before going into the breakout room was helpful. ,It would have been better to use those 40 mins to dive into the curriculum with our site teams to work on how to make it more culturally relevant.

When shown the formula it was very briefly mentioned that number of moves was growing exponentially and that is where the equation came from.  Students were not asked to do any ""heavy lifting"" to come up with the formula and it actually wasn't even explained how the ""teacher"" came up with the (2^n)-1.
