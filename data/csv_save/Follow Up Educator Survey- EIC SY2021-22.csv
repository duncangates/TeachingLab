The time would have been much better spent teaching the classes I had to miss to attend these fluff piece pds.,"Facilitators should have been people with actual real world experience teaching this curriculum.  NOT ONE person who presented or met with us throughout the entire year had any real world experience with this curriculum.  Stop filling time by spending the first hour describing what you're going to be presenting in the second hour.  Stop deliberately slowing down the pd's by modelling things we don't need. I don't need to see you model wait time for every single question/action/activity.  Some of the ""advice"" we were initially given like, ""follow with fidelity"" was misleading.  Most of the pd was not responsive to our needs or pacing issues. ",,Unpacking curriculum,"Implementing effective, evidence-based instructional practices",,,,,"Professional learning in general is difficult to present. If you're trying to design profession learning for a curriculum but you are using people with no experience teaching the curriculum it becomes even more difficult to make that pd useful. This just felt like you and everyone involved were just checking off boxes. In the end it was left to teachers to find their own way. Losing class time to attend these pds left me at net loss. Overall the professional developments were a failure. Would not renew contract.  While the people that presented were very kind and professional (I do not blame them), it seems top to bottom we were all setup to fail."
