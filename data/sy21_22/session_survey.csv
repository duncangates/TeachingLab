I appreciated that a lot.  Additionally, she is great at giving specific directions and is very clear in her communication. I also appreciated the connection from the target/ objective to the specific activity. I hadn't seen that done before but it helped orient everyone. ","There were many things: 1.  I just wanted to say thanks for the dedication to collecting survey data and then implementing it.  I love how transparent you all are about this.   2. You set up most if not all activities to have processing time first.  This is great for introverts and just as a way for everyone to collect their thoughts before sharing out. 3. You took feedback, specifically around creating a safe space for participants and did that before we started any student model. ","I think there were two main things; 1. directions were sometimes unclear or confusing. 2. The pacing somehow felt off today. While I understand why modeling the MLR had to happen, it felt like we had basically just done that specific one after the previous model. So for the future, perhaps choosing a very different MLR to model might help.  Also, I get frustrated when the times change after we are sent to breakout rooms.  I get it that you need to make everything fit.  Our group had budgeted the time according to the original times we were given.  I totally understand making changes before we are sent  to breakout rooms, but as a result three members didn't get to share and I felt badly. Finally, I'm wondering if there is a way to ""pep"" things up especially when we hit the 2:30/3:00 mark. I know this is a lot and I want to make sure everyone knows the session was still great.  These are just the ideas I had. "

I feel like what we are learning, I already learned from our district resource teachers/district math department over the last 2+ years. This is probably helpful for teachers new to the curriculum, but I'm not learning anything new which is frustrating. There was a brief mention of culturally relevant teaching, but it was very brief and nothing clear or concrete was given."

Furthermore, it was later revealed that the number of moves required could come from the equation  total moves = (2^n)-1 .   When shown the formula it was very briefly mentioned that number of moves was growing exponentially and that is where the equation came from.  Students were not asked to do any ""heavy lifting"" to come up with the formula and it actually wasn't even explained how the ""teacher"" came up with the (2^n)-1.
